**ðŸš€ SQL Learning Journey: Customer Churn Analysis**

From this project, I practiced and learned:

1. Data Retrieval & Database Management
2. Data Cleaning with DISTINCT & COUNT
3. Mathematical & Logical operations on data
4. Creating calculated columns for insights
5. Aggregating & Summarizing data (GROUP BY, AVG, COUNT)
6. Business Insights â€“ churn rate, top customers, segmentation

ðŸ’¡ **Main Skill Used:** 
SQL (Structured Query Language) â€“ for data retrieval, cleaning, analysis, and insights.

**These queries helped me strengthen my SQL for Data Science skills.**
